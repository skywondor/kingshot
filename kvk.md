# KVK

## What's it ? / C'est quoi

### English
The "Kingdom of Power" better known as Kingdom versus Kingdom (KvK), is the most important monthly event where two kingdoms are matched to compete for supremacy. 
The ultimate goals are to earn incredible rewards and for the victorious kingdom's top alliance to appoint a High King.

Frequency: The KvK event KingShot occurs monthly, specifically during the fourth week of the month. 
Main Rewards: Exclusive skins, Kingdom Coins, powerful server-wide buffs, and the prestigious title of "High King."
The KVK is broken down four phases.

### Français
Le « Royaume du Pouvoir », plus connu sous le nom de Royaume contre Royaume (KvK), est l'événement mensuel le plus important où deux royaumes s'affrontent pour la suprématie. 
L'objectif ultime est de remporter des récompenses exceptionnelles et de permettre à la meilleure alliance du royaume victorieux de nommer un Haut Roi.

Fréquence : L'événement KvK « KingShot » a lieu chaque mois, plus précisément durant la quatrième semaine. 
Principales récompenses : Apparences exclusives, Pièces du Royaume, puissants bonus pour l'ensemble du serveur et le titre prestigieux de « Haut Roi ». 
Le KvK se déroule en quatre phases.

## Phase 1: Matchmaking - 2 Days

### English
This is the initial pairing stage where the stage is set for the upcoming conflict.

* Day 1: The game's system evaluates your kingdom's total power, calculated from the troop power of the top 100 governors. It then finds an opposing kingdom with a nearly identical power level.
* Day 2: Your opponent is officially revealed.

Tips: Use this crucial time to study your opponent. A highly recommended tactic is to create a new character in this kingdom. This intelligence-gathering mission allows you to get a first-hand look at their most powerful players and alliances, giving you a strategic edge.

### Français
Il s'agit de la phase initiale d'appariement, qui prépare le terrain pour le conflit à venir.

* Jour 1 : Le système du jeu évalue la puissance totale de votre royaume, calculée à partir de la puissance militaire des 100 gouverneurs les plus puissants. Il vous trouve ensuite un royaume adverse d'un niveau de puissance quasi identique.
* Jour 2 : Votre adversaire est officiellement révélé.

Conseils : Profitez de ce moment crucial pour étudier votre adversaire. Une tactique fortement recommandée consiste à créer un nouveau personnage dans ce royaume. Cette mission de collecte de renseignements vous permettra d'observer de près ses joueurs les plus puissants et ses alliances, vous offrant ainsi un avantage stratégique.

## Phase 2: Prep Phase - 5 Days
This phase is a 5-day point-earning marathon that directly impacts the final battle. The kingdom that scores more points during the KingShot KvK Prep Phase wins the critical "State Bonus" for the Battle Phase.

Key Principle: Success in the KingShot KvK Prep Phase requires kingdom-wide participation. A single player or alliance cannot win it alone.

Important Social Advice for KvK KingShot:

Respect all players and encourage participation.
Do not zero alliances that have high-spending players ("spenders"). If these key players quit the game out of frustration, it will be a devastating loss for the entire server in all future KingShot KvK events.
